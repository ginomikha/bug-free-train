All my testing ability and protfolio

I am a new and aspiring tech enthusiast with a strong interest in Quality Assurance. I recently completed a 5-month certification course focused on mastering test case creation and execution. I use IntelliJ for automation and regression testing, and I also work with SQL to validate data and ensure database integrity. As a QA professional, I am committed to identifying all existing defects to help ensure that the company or software owner delivers a high-performance, reliable application to end users.
